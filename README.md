# Examen_JavaBasics

Last version includes packages and their classes (with their methods) for:
  
 	-Reading from a CSV file (with its route inside the config.propertis file)
 	-Getting the last thursday of the month (by using input parameters)
 	-Getting the next day of a given date
 	-Main class to call other classes.
  
There were also created two unitary tests:

 	-For the CSVFileReader class, test passed, all ok
 	-For the GetLastThursday class, test implementation incorrect.
  
Actually, the output isn't correct, as it shows the hashcode formed by the ArrayList of the CSV file.
